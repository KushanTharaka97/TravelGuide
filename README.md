# TravelGuide
TravelGuide app by native android platform.

The mobile app that is specifically dedicated to travelers,
the app is built on the native platform so the speed is higher than others. In this app, 
I want to learn the native architecture and framework. How to data parse Uri, adapter concept and etc. 

So when we consider the app the app has few countries and their details, we can make favorite or not, 
keep a quick memo about the country,
look at the stored details and so on, the UI also designed according to UX laws so User Experience will be so high.
